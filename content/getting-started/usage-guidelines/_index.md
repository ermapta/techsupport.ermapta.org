ERMA PTA resources are subject to the following guidelines.

1. Microsoft provides ERMA PTA with a full set of applications for communication and productivity. The [nonprofit eligibility requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/eligibility) provide guidelines on who we can extend the donated offers to and how we can use the software.
2. As a member of Washington State PTA, ERMA PTA is also subject to [WSPTA governance policies](https://www.wastatepta.org/pta-leaders/governance/).
3. TODO: We probably should have some sort of code of conduct.

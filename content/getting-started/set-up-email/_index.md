## What you will learn

This article will introduce you to the basic functionality of your email account:

1. Accessing your email account
2. Pro tips for sending and receiving email
3. Tips for scheduling meetings
4. Intro to shared mailboxes

### Prerequisites

1. You will need your username and password to set up your email. If you have not received your username and password, email [techsupport@ermapta.org][email-techsupport].
2. You should have logged in at least once to <https://www.office.com>; doing this ensures that any required password reset is addressed before attempting to log into an email client.

## About your email address

Most staff members and volunteers have been configured with a user account and email address. You can receive or send email from a Web browser or an email client like Outlook or Gmail.

Your email address is intended primarily for official communication. It is completely reasonable to use the email address occasionally for personal purposes, but please do not make a habit of this. (See [usage guidelines](/getting-started/usage-guidelines).)

## Accessing email

### From a browser

You can use any device with a Web browser to access your email account. Simply go to <https://www.office.com> and click on `Outlook`, or navigate directly to <https://outlook.office.com>.

### From an email client (recommended)

Microsoft Outlook is the recommended email client for two reasons:

1. Outlook is consistently one of the top two email apps in app stores and "best email app" metareviews (such as [this one by the Verge][verge-review]).
2. Microsoft develops the email service. When Microsoft also develops the email client, it is reasonable to expect the service and client to work well together.

#### Outlook

| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |


1. Install Outlook from your device's app store.
2. Tap `Add Account` and enter your email address.
   a. If this is the first account you're adding, simply type the email address in the provided field.
   b. Otherwise, tap `Settings > Add Account > Add Email Account` and type your email address there.
3. Enter your password and tap `Sign in`.
4. If multi-factor authentication is enabled on your account, verify your identity by following the prompts.
5. Grant consent in subsequent dialogs.

#### Mail and Calendar (Outlook alternative for Windows)

Mail and Calendar are Windows apps that provide a similar experience to Outlook.

[{{< imgproc microsoft-store-badge Resize "200x" />}}][windows-download]

1. Install [Mail and Calendar][windows-download] from the Microsoft app store.
2. Tap `Add Account`, then `Exchange` (our accounts are Office 365) and enter your email address.
   a. If this is the first account you're adding, simply type the email address in the provided field.
   b. Otherwise, tap `Settings > Manage Accounts > Add account` and type your email address there.
3. Enter your password and tap `Sign in`.
4. If multi-factor authentication is enabled on your account, verify your identity by following the prompts.

## Intro to shared mailboxes

Shared mailboxes are a bit different than the mailbox attached to a user account. Shared mailboxes are accessible by multiple users. For instance, an email like `volunteer@ermapta.org` may require multiple users to manage the email volume.

Users who have access to a shared mailbox can read the email sent to the mailbox and send email on behalf of the mailbox. For example, a user who has access to the `volunteer@ermapta.org` mailbox can send emails from that address.

For more information, see [Shared mailboxes](/collaboration/shared-mailboxes).

Pages form the backbone of our website. From the home page to the calendar to the supporters page, pages are our most critical content.

{{% alert title="Important!" color="warning" %}}We manage pages with Elementor, not the default editor ("Gutenberg"/"Block Editor"). If one person uses Elementor and another uses a different editor, Bad Things Will Happen (tm).{{% /alert %}}

While it is possible to use raw code to manage pages in WordPress, the whole point of a CMS is to enable fast and easy content creation. WordPress ships with a built-in editor called [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/). While it is a good editor overall, most folks prefer [Elementor](https://elementor.com/).

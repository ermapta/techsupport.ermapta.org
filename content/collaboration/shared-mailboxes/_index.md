## About shared mailboxes

In some cases multiple people need to read or send email from a single address. For instance, an email like `volunteer@ermapta.org` may require multiple users to manage the email volume.

Users who have access to a shared mailbox can read the email sent to the mailbox and send email on behalf of the mailbox. A user who has access to the `volunteer@ermapta.org` mailbox can send emails from that address.

This video gives a brief overview of how to use shared mailboxes:

## 3 tips for using shared mailboxes

Three handy tips for working with shared mailboxes:

1. When you **reply to an email** in a shared mailbox, Outlook will automatically reply from the shared mailbox's email address. :tada:
2. When you **create a new email**, you can click `Show From` (might be on the `Options` tab and/or under an ellipsis, e.g. `...`) and choose whether the email comes from you or one of your shared mailboxes. The first time you send a message from a shared mailbox, you'll need to add the address. See the video above for how to do this.
3. If you're using Outlook on the web or through a mobile client, you'll need to add the shared mailbox. See the video above for how to do this. Outlook Desktop automatically adds the shared mailbox.
